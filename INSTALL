ELaSTIC - Efficient LArge Scale Taxonomy Independent Clustering

1. Compatibility

This software has been implemented in C++, OpenMP-2.5 and MPI-2 standards.
It has been tested with the major C++ compilers and MPI implementations,
including on platforms such as the IBM Blue Gene. In practice, any standard
conforming C++ compiler and MPI library can be used.

2. Requirements

The main requirement are the Boost C++ Libraries, version 1.48 or newer. To
compile all tools except of elastic-sketch, three compiled Boost libraries are
necessary: Boost.Filesystem, Boost.IOstreams and Boost.System. elastic-sketch
depends on header-only libraries, e.g. Boost.Tuple. Note, that all major Linux
distributions provide Boost by default. Otherwise, the Boost libraries can be
obtained from http://www.boost.org/. Finally, to build elastic-sketch, which
usually will be done on a cluster, MPI implementation compatible with the MPI-2
standard and with MPI I/O support is required. Examples include MPICH
(http://www.mpich.org/) and Open MPI (http://www.open-mpi.org/). Note, that many
hardware vendors provide MPI libraries derived from one of these implementations.
