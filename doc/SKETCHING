List of MPE phases in the edge generation routine.
Version 1.71 (notation as in HiCOMB paper):

1. generate sketch_list: each processor enumerates (x,r,d) tuple
2. group sketch_list: processors perform all-to-all binning to get list L^i
3. decompose sketch_list: break L^i and pre-balance
4. balance sketch_list: perform load balancing of L^i
5. get counts: enumerate pairs as prescribed by sketches in L^i to get W^i
6. compact counts: perform reduction to count how many time given pair has been enumerated
