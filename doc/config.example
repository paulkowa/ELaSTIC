# Set input data type.
# Two types are supported:
# nt = DNA/RNA,
# aa = proteins.
# Default: nt
; type = nt

# Select compressed amino acid alphabet (valid for proteins only).
# Any alphabet can be defined in the form [group1,group2,...,groupN].
# For example [AGPST,C,DENQ,FWY,HKR,ILMV] defines 6 groups.
# Additionally, two alphabets are predefined:
# A20 = standard amino acids,
# Dayhoff6 = 6 groups (see Edgar, NAR 2004; 32(1):380-385).
# Default: A20
; sigma = A20

# Use compressed alphabet during validation (valid for proteins only).
# Default: 0
; compress = 0

# Select method to perform validation.
# Currently, three methods are available:
# 0 = kmer fraction,
# 1 = CD-HIT identity from global alignment with cost-free end gaps.
# 2 = CD-HIT identity from global alignment.
# 3 = BLAST identity from global alignment with cost-free end gaps.
# 4 = BLAST identity from global alignment.
# Default: 0
; method = 0

# Set affine gap alignment parameters (valid for alignment-based methods only).
# Format used is [match, substitution, gap opening, gap extension],
# or [substitution matrix path, gap opening, gap extension].
# For example [/scratch/blosum62.txt,-10,-1] will use matrix from
# /scratch/blosum62.txt.
# Default: [5,-4,-10,-1]
; gaps = [5,-4,-10,-1]

# Set kmer size used during the sketching phase, and during validation
# if the kmer fraction method is selected.
# Default: 15
; kmer = 15

# Set the threshold value above which edges are considered valid.
# Default: 75
; level = 75

# Set mod value for the sketching phase.
# Default: 25
; mod = 25

# Set the number of iterations in the sketching phase.
# Default: 7
; iter = 7

# Set the limit to mark frequent kmers.
# Default: 5000
; cmax = 5000

# Set the threshold to extract candidate edges.
# Default: 50
; jmin = 50

# Enable work stealing in the validation phase.
# Default: 1
; wsq = 1
