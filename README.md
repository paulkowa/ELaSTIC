## About

ELaSTIC is a software suite for a rapid identification and clustering of
similar sequences from large-scale biological sequence collections
without explicit all-pairs alignment.

ELaSTIC is designed to work with data sets consisting of millions of DNA/RNA
or amino acid strings, using various similarity criteria.

ELaSTIC is extremely efficient and scalable while maintaining sensitivity
thanks to the clever use of the MinHash and sketching technique, and the
application of carefully engineered parallel algorithms.

ELaSTIC follows a modular design, and it can be easily combined with other
tools, like MCL, for the downstream analysis.
